# Logisti-Regression-using-Python
We took a banking dataset using which we had to predict whether the customer will subscribe for a term deposit or not.

There was a lot of information about the customer such as customerâ€™s job, education, loan status, home loan status, last made call, outcome of the call etc.

After initial screening the following variables were selected to be the explanatory variables:
'job', 'marital', 'default', 'housing', 'loan', 'poutcome'
